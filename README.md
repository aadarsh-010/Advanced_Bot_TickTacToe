The Tic-Tac-Toe project is a computer game that allows players to enjoy the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. The game features a user-friendly interface and multiple difficulty levels, including easy, medium, and hard.

The main objective of the project is to provide an interactive gaming experience where users can challenge themselves against an intelligent AI player. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their respective marks (either 'X' or 'O') on the board.

The AI player is programmed to make strategic moves based on the chosen difficulty level. In the easy mode, the AI may make random moves without considering advanced strategies. The medium difficulty level introduces basic logic to the AI's decision-making process, making it slightly more challenging for the player. Lastly, the hard difficulty level provides a formidable opponent by employing advanced algorithms and game theory to make optimal moves, and it's impossible to win at this level giving users a brainstorming experience.

The project offers an intuitive user interface that allows players to select the game mode, choose their preferred difficulty level, and start playing against the AI. The game board is visually represented, making it easy for players to visualize the current state of the game and plan their next move accordingly. The AI player's moves are indicated on the board, and the game tracks the progress, determining the winner or a tie when applicable.

By implementing this Tic-Tac-Toe game project, players can enhance their logical thinking, strategizing, and decision-making skills while having fun. The adjustable difficulty levels cater to players of various skill levels, providing an enjoyable experience for both beginners and experienced players alike.
